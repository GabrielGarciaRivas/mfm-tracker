## 2610.12.001 — 2026-10-13

### New
- **Channel prompt:** the app asks for your channel when it starts and after you change

  it shows in Settings (default 20).

- The app is now called **Free Market Tracker**, "Free Market price tracker for MapleStory
  Classic World". Its technical name is `mfm-tracker`; from source, run
  `python mfm-tracker gui`.
- **Capture every** defaults to 0.15 seconds.
- **Required sightings before judging** (was "Outliers: judge after this many sightings")
  now also applies to DEAL / HIGH: an item needs 5 sightings before it gets a market price.
  **Flag DEAL / HIGH** moved under it in Settings.
- From source on Linux, `pynput` is only needed for the `hotkey` command.
- Simpler wording in the app, the README and the changelog.
